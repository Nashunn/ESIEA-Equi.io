# ESIEA-Equiweb
> A website for a horse riding club ðŸŽ 

## Introduction
This application was made as part of our school work at ESIEA.
We had to work in pairs, and our team is composed of ![Nicolas BOULLET](https://github.com/Nashunn) and ![Yohan LE BRICQUER](https://github.com/yohanleb).

The purpose was to create a website with Angular and see what the creation of a website implies. 
We chose to make this application in Angular with a Node.js backend. 

## Instructions
- User : 
  - can register to become a horse rider
- Horse rider : 
  - edit his personal information (name, surname, e-mail address, telephone number) so that he can be contacted if necessary
  - register in available resumptions by filtering them by level
  - consult the resumptions where I am registered to know which horse I am going to ride
- Instructors : 
  - create a resumption schedule by choosing the times and levels of the riders (levels = from 1 to 7, or Gallop)
  - connect to the site to create resumptions ( lessons ) to associate horses to my riders
- Administrator :
  - search for a horse rider and see his personal information to be able to contact him
  - create accounts for the instructors with their personal information (last name, first name, e-mail address, telephone number) so they can log on to the site
  - manage the list of the club's horses (name) so that the instructors can associate them with the riders
